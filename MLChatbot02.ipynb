            "Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how your body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is vital to your health because it's an important source of energy for the cells that make up your muscles and tissues. It's also your brain's main source of fuel.\n",
            "\n",
            "The underlying cause of diabetes varies by type. But, no matter what type of diabetes you have, it can lead to excess sugar in your blood. Too much sugar in your blood can lead to serious health problems.\n",

            "Chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes — when your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes — and gestational diabetes, which occurs during pregnancy but may resolve after the baby is delivered.\n",

            "\n",
            "Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are:\n",

            "\n",
            "The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream.\n",

            "The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells.\n",
            "\n",
            "Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream.\n",
            "\n",
            "As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas.\n",
            "\n",
            "The role of glucose\n",
            "\n",
            "Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.\n",
            "\n",
            "Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.\n",
            "\n",
            "Your liver stores and makes glucose.\n",
            "\n",
            "When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range.\n",
            "\n",
            "Causes of type 1 diabetes\n",
            "\n",
            "The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream.\n",
            "\n",
            "Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes.\n",
